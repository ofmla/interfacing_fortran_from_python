Training course -- Interfacing Fortran and Python: Using cffi, ctypes and cython


In this course you will get a basic knowledge on different alternatives of calling Fortran code from Python. The course focuses on the explicit C interface route, that is,
coding explicit C interface in Fortran and calling that with Python libraries like ctypes, cffi, etc. Although there are several automatic wrapper generation tools available (see, for instance, [here](https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Python)), they wont be covered by the course.
